<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<!-- 

This template is designed to process XML output from PycParser,
the primary purpose being to normalize the format of the ASTs in XML.
This normalization process makes the AST XML structure cleaner and more
consistent, which is particularly helpful in understanding and visualizing
the changes brought about by subsequent XSLT transformations. The
template does this by stripping away any unnecessary white space
and ensuring that all elements and attributes are copied as they are,
without any alteration. By setting the output to be XML with indentation,
it further enhances readability, making it easier for users to see the
structure and content of the original XML data. This step is essential
for those who need to clearly understand the transformations applied in
later stages of processing.
